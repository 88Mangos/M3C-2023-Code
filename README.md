# M3C-2023-Code

Q1_Graphs.m, Q2_Graphs.m, and Q3_Graphs.m work upon the same original dataset and fit_logistic function found in fit_logistic.m
The MATLAB files were used to make Figures 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.3, and 3.1.

The Python code in the Jupyter Notebook file named p1.ipynb were used to make Figures 2.1 and 2.2.

The Excel File, TCP23_data.xlsx, is our modified version of the original dataset from https://m3challenge.siam.org/node/596. It is crudely organized; the cleaner version is viewable on the final submission, in Tables 1-1-1.6.
